Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible while managing your token budget wisely. Your token budget has two main uses: 1) Limiting the length of your output responses, and 2) Purchasing hints for problems.\n\nBefore taking any action, you should:\n1. Analyze the current competition state and your remaining resources\n2. Evaluate the difficulty and potential score of each problem\n3. Consider the optimal strategy for token usage (e.g., when to use hints)\n4. Plan your approach to maximize score while minimizing token consumption\n\nPlease respond with a JSON object containing 'action' and 'parameters' fields."

All of these $K$ moves happen simultaneously, so the after the rotation is complete, all of the active positions still contain exactly one cow.  Next, the active positions themselves shift:\n$A_1$ becomes $A_1+1$, $A_2$ becomes $A_2+1$, and so on (if $A_i = N-1$ for some active position, then $A_i$ circles back around to $0$).\n\nPlease calculate the order of the cows after $T$ minutes of the dance ($1\\le T\\le 10^9$).\n\nINPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):\nThe first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $T$.\n\nThe second line contains $K$ integers representing the initial set of active positions\n$A_1,A_2, \\ldots A_K$.

A cow resides at each position.  The cows are also numbered sequentially from $0$ to $N-1$.  Initially, cow $i$ starts in position $i$.  You are told a set of $K$ positions $0=A_1<A_2< \\ldots< A_K<N$ that are \"active\", meaning the cows in these positions are the next to move ($1 \\leq K \\leq N$).  \n\nIn each minute of the dance, two things happen.  First, the cows in the active positions rotate: the cow at position $A_1$ moves to position $A_2$, the cow at position $A_2$ moves to position $A_3$, and so on, with the cow at position $A_K$ moving to position $A_1$.  All of these $K$ moves happen simultaneously, so the after the rotation is complete, all of the active positions still contain exactly one cow.  Next, the active positions themselves shift:\n$A_1$ becomes $A_1+1$, $A_2$ becomes $A_2+1$, and so on (if $A_i = N-1$ for some active position, then $A_i$ circles back around to $0$).\n\nPlease calculate the order of the cows after $T$ minutes of the dance ($1\\le T\\le 10^9$).\n\nINPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):\nThe first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $T$.\n\nThe second line contains $K$ integers representing the initial set of active positions\n$A_1,A_2, \\ldots A_K$.
