Your token budget has two main uses: 1) Limiting the length of your output responses, and 2) Purchasing hints for problems.\n\nBefore taking any action, you should:\n1. Analyze the current competition state and your remaining resources\n2. Evaluate the difficulty and potential score of each problem\n3. Consider the optimal strategy for token usage (e.g., when to use hints)\n4. Plan your approach to maximize score while minimizing token consumption\n\nPlease respond with a JSON object containing 'action' and 'parameters' fields."

The cows are\nleaving the farm for vacation one by one. On day $i$, the $i$th cow leaves the\nfarm, and then all pairs of the $i$th cow's friends still present on the farm\nbecome friends. \n\nFor each $i$ from $1$ to $N$, just before the $i$th cow leaves,  how many\nordered triples of distinct cows $(a,b,c)$ are there such that none of $a,b,c$\nare on vacation, $a$ is friends with $b$, and $b$ is friends with $c$?\n\nINPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):\nThe first line contains $N$.\n\nThe next $N-1$ lines contain two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ denoting that cows\n$u_i$ and $v_i$ are initially friends ($1\\le u_i,v_i\\le N$).\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\nThe answers for $i$ from $1$ to $N$ on separate lines.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n2\n0\n0\n\n$(1,2,3)$ and $(3,2,1)$ are the triples just before cow $1$ leaves.\n\nAfter cow\n$1$ leaves, there are less than $3$ cows left, so no triples are possible.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n6\n6\n0\n0\n\nAt the beginning, cow $1$ is friends with all other cows, and no other pairs of\ncows are friends, so the triples are $(a, 1, c)$ where $a, c$ are different cows\nfrom $\\{2, 3, 4\\}$, which gives $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ triples.\n\nAfter cow $1$ leaves, the remaining three cows are all friends, so the triples\nare just those three cows in any of the $3! = 6$ possible orders.\n\nAfter cow $2$ leaves, there are less than $3$ cows left, so no triples are\npossible.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n5\n3 5\n5 1\n1 4\n1 2\nSAMPLE OUTPUT: \n8\n10\n2\n0\n0\n\nSCORING:\nInputs 4-5: $N\\le 500$Inputs 6-10: $N\\le 5000$Inputs 11-20: No additional constraints.\n\n\nProblem credits: Aryansh Shrivastava, Benjamin Qi\n\n\nSample Cases:\nCase 1:\nInput:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\nExpected Output:\n2\n0\n0\n\nCase 2:\nInput:\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nExpected Output:\n6\n6\n0\n0\n\nCase 3:\nInput:\n5\n3 5\n5 1\n1 4\n1 2\nExpected Output:\n8\n10\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n\nAnalyze the current situation, think about your strategy, and pay attention to the output token limit.
