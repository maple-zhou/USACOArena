Analyze the current competition state and your remaining resources\n2. Evaluate the difficulty and potential score of each problem\n3. Consider the optimal strategy for token usage (e.g., when to use hints)\n4.

      "content": "Based on the provided competition state and available actions, I need to decide which action to take next. Since I have no solved problems yet and my token budget is substantial, I can afford to explore options carefully. Here's an analysis:\n\n1. **View Problem**: This action allows me to gather more information about a problem before deciding how to proceed. It doesn't consume tokens but helps in planning.\n\n2. **Get Hint**: Hints can provide valuable insights into the problem-solving process, especially for complex problems. However, they do consume tokens, so I must consider the cost-benefit ratio.\n\n3. **Submit Solution**: This action requires writing code and submitting it for evaluation. The cost depends on the outcome, so I need to ensure that I'm confident enough in my solution before submitting.\n\n4. **Terminate**: This option ends my participation prematurely and would result in a lower final score unless I've already achieved a high score through other means.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will start by viewing one of the problems to gain better understanding and then decide on further steps. I'll choose a problem that seems moderately challenging and likely solvable within my token budget.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"VIEW_PROBLEM\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"problem_id\": \"1334_platinum_triples_of_cows\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis choice aims to balance exploration with the potential for gaining useful insights without spending too many tokens upfront.
