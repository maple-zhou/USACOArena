Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible while managing your token budget wisely. Your token budget has two main uses: 1) Limiting the length of your output responses, and 2) Purchasing hints for problems.\n\nBefore taking any action, you should:\n1. Analyze the current competition state and your remaining resources\n2. Evaluate the difficulty and potential score of each problem\n3. Consider the optimal strategy for token usage (e.g., when to use hints)\n4. Plan your approach to maximize score while minimizing token consumption\n\nPlease respond with a JSON object containing 'action' and 'parameters' fields."

      "content": "# Competition State\n\n## Competition: MAS Programming Competition 2025\nDescription: A competition to test MAS coding abilities in solving programming problems\n\n## Competition Rules\n\n### Token Budget:\n- Each participant has a maximum of 10000000.0 tokens\n- Tokens are used for:\n  1. Limiting the length of your output responses\n  2. Purchasing hints (cost increases with hint level)\n  3. Submitting solutions (cost varies based on submission status)\n- Running out of tokens will terminate your participation\n- Remaining tokens at the end of competition will be converted to bonus points\n  - Bonus points = (remaining_tokens / initial_tokens) * lambda\n  - Lambda is a multiplier defined in competition rules (default: 100)\n\n### Scoring Rules:\n- Bronze problems: 100 points each\n- Gold problems: 500 points each\n- Platinum problems: 1000 points each\n- Silver problems: 200 points each\n\nPoints are awarded proportionally to the number of test cases passed. For example, if you pass 7 out of 10 test cases for a Bronze problem, you'll receive 70 points.\n\n### Penalties:\nEach submission with the following results will incur a penalty:\n- CE: 5 points\n- MLE: 10 points\n- RE: 10 points\n- TLE: 10 points\n- WA: 10 points\n\n### Bonus:\nThe first participant to solve each problem completely will receive a 100-point bonus.\n\n### Final Score Calculation:\n- Base Score: Sum of points from solved problems\n- Token Bonus: (remaining_tokens / initial_tokens) * lambda\n- Final Score = Base Score + Token Bonus\n\n### Programming Languages:\nAvailable languages: C++17, Java, and Python3.\n\nImportant Notes:\n- C++17 solutions are guaranteed to pass all test cases within time limits\n- Java and Python solutions may not be able to pass all test cases due to time constraints\n- Choose your programming language wisely based on the problem requirements\n\n## Your Status\n- Name: glm-4v-flash\n- Remaining Tokens: 10000000.0\n- Solved Problems: None\n- Current Score: 100.0\n\n## Available Problems\n- problem_id: 1334_platinum_triples_of_cows, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1333_platinum_good_bitstrings, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1332_platinum_pareidolia, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1331_gold_tree_merging, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1330_gold_pareidolia, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1329_gold_custodial_cleanup, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1328_silver_pareidolia, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1327_silver_field_day, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1326_silver_milk_sum, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1325_bronze_rotate_and_shift, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1324_bronze_moo_language, first_to_solve: None\n- problem_id: 1323_bronze_feb, first_to_solve: None\n\n## Current Rankings\n\n\n## Available Actions\n\n1. VIEW_PROBLEM\n   - Action: \"VIEW_PROBLEM\"\n   - Parameters: { \"problem_id\": \"<problem_id>\" }\n   - Description: View detailed information about a specific problem\n   - Returns: Problem title, description, and sample test cases\n\n2. GET_HINT\n   - Action: \"GET_HINT\"\n   - Parameters: { \"problem_id\": \"<problem_id>\", \"hint_level\": <level> }\n   - Description: Get a hint for a problem (consumes tokens)\n   - Hint Levels:\n     1. Basic Hint (500 tokens):\n        - Provides relevant textbook knowledge\n        - Explains theoretical concepts and solution strategies\n     2. Detailed Hint (1000 tokens):\n        - Shows similar problems and their solutions\n        - Helps understand the problem type and basic approach\n     3. Comprehensive Hint (1500 tokens):\n        - Combines similar problems and textbook knowledge\n        - Includes integration guide for applying concepts\n   - Returns: Hint content and token cost\n\n3. SUBMIT_SOLUTION\n   - Action: \"SUBMIT_SOLUTION\"\n   - Parameters: {\n     \"problem_id\": \"<problem_id>\",\n     \"solution\": \"<your_code>\",\n     \"language\": \"<cpp|java|python>\"\n   }\n   - Description: Submit a solution for a problem (consumes tokens)\n   - Token Cost:\n     - Each submission consumes tokens based on the submission status\n     - Cost varies depending on whether the solution is accepted or rejected\n     - Default cost is 100 tokens if not specified in competition rules\n   - Returns: Submission status, score, and test case results\n\n4. TERMINATE\n   - Action: \"TERMINATE\"\n   - Parameters: {}\n   - Description: End your participation in the competition\n   - Returns: Final score and ranking\n\nPlease respond using the following JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"<action_name>\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    // Fill in parameters according to the action type\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnalyze the current situation, think about your strategy, and pay attention to the output token limit. Then respond with a JSON object containing 'action' and 'parameters' fields."
